## Traffic Sign Classifier

### Overview

In this project, I use a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. I train a model so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, I test it on new images of traffic signs both from a testing dataset, and also some random traffic signs I find near my home in India. 

### Dependencies

This project requires **Python 3.5** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/)
- [TensorFlow](http://tensorflow.org)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (Optional)

Run this command at the terminal prompt to install [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/). Useful for image processing:

- `conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3`

### Project
The entire project has been built and described in detail in an IPython notebook which can be found in the root of this folder, named [Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb](Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb). 

I've saved the notebook as the HTML file as well, named [report.html](report.html), just in case :)
